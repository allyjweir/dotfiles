# `allyjweir`'s dotfiles

Every time I have moved machine I have started afresh with new dotfiles ready to be littered with dozens of aliases, random workarounds and hacks to 'just make it work'. This works when you change machine every two to three years but now with Codespaces I have a "new machine" every few days.

## Priorities

1. `zsh` is the superior terminal
2. Having the clever `history` autocomplete based on what I've typed so far is essential
3. One character aliases that will no doubt collide one day is preferrable (`k` > `kubectl`)
4. Auto-completion for commands is helpful
5. asdf is handy for installing random additional tools

## How to Use

After doing a one-off [initial configuration in GitHub settings](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/customizing-your-codespace/personalizing-github-codespaces-for-your-account#dotfiles) the dotfiles will be picked up in all newly created Codespaces.

Note to future self, if you make changes then you need to recreate the codespace to have them picked up.
